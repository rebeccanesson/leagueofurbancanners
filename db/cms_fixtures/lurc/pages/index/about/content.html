The&nbsp;<b>League of Urban Canners</b>&nbsp;(LUrC) is an urban food production cooperative where members of the community share responsibility for farming, harvesting and processing fruit grown in their city.<br><br>Each year, thousands of pounds of fruit goes to waste in cities because most property owners do not have the time or resources to harvest their fruit trees, place low value on non-commercial produce, or do not have the capacity to consume or process their fruit. LUrC contracts with owners to farm and harvest their fruit in exchange for a share of the product of the harvest. Coop member also receive a share of the processed fruit based on their contribution of work.<br><br>LUrC is open to all members of the community. There is no fee to join. LUrC is neither a non-profit nor a for-profit, but an economically independent cooperative using processed fruit as the common currency of exchange.<h2>Farming</h2>Through the winter, LUrC maintains trees through pruning and soil enhancements in order to improve fruit production. Pruners must have prior experience or attend one of our pruning workshops offered in late fall.<h2>Harvesting</h2>Fruit trees are harvested beginning in the spring with mulberries and continuing through late fall with quince and persimmons. Most trees are harvested in one or two 2-hour sessions by a 3-5 members team. No experience is necessary.<h2>Processing</h2>Members process fruit in their own kitchens usually in groups of 1-4. Most members join without knowing how to preserve fruit and learn by working with other members.<br><br>Our goal is offer an alternative model for urban food production, that provides access to low-cost food, fosters community interdependence, and is economically and organizational self-sufficient without paid staff or external funding.<br>
