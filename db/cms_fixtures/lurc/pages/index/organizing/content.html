You can get more involved with LUrC by becoming a site coordinator, team leader,&nbsp;or joining the Neighborhood Fruit Watch. If you are interested in any one of&nbsp;these opportunities, please send an email to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow">organize@leagueofurbancanners.org</a>.<br><br><h3>Site Coordinator</h3>Unlike a traditional orchard, our fruit trees are hidden behind buildings on&nbsp;located on many different properties. As result, we need many site coordinators&nbsp;who each oversee one or more trees in our database. Each coordinator is&nbsp;responsible for:<br><ul><li>Contacting the owner each harvest season,</li><li>regularly checking the fruit for ripeness, and</li><li>scheduling the harvest.</li></ul><h3>Team Leader</h3><div>Harvest and pruning sessions are generally team activities with one experienced&nbsp;leader. Canning sessions are often less formal though are sometimes larger&nbsp;events. If you have experience with harvesting, pruning, or canning and would&nbsp;like to lead teams, please let us know.</div><h3>Neighborhood Fruit Watch (NFW)</h3>As a member of the NFW you can help us find new sites for harvesting. This is a&nbsp;fun way for you or your family and friends to be involved and help us keep&nbsp;fruit off the street. All you have to do is select a few streets that you&nbsp;regularly travel by foot or bike and keep an eye out for fruit growing in&nbsp;yards. Think of it as a scavenger hunt while you walk the dog. When you spot&nbsp;fruit just contact us with the address and your best guess at what fruit it&nbsp;might be. You can also leave a flyer or try contact the owner, but this is not&nbsp;required.
